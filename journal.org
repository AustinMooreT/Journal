    With the task structure an open task is also an area. This I think I'm set on.

*** TODO Add X support CIRU <<PG:OT2>>
  CIRU is a "Checkpoint and Restore" applciation for linux.
  What that means is that it takes all of the process state
  and writes it to disk, and then can restore it at a later date.

  I want to use CIRU to save current window layouts in xmonad to disk.
  The problem with this is that the Xserver stores application state relating
  to X that is not saved by CIRU. The solution would be to query the Xserver and
  obtain all of the info relating to our application, then write that to disk upon
  "checkpoint" and then upon "restore" we reset the X connection and provide it
  with all of the state needed.

  NOTE I'm going to leave everything as is in here, but I'm going to say a few things about why this is not
  really doable. So when an X application is running it has a connection with the Xserver. This connection consists of
  a unique ID that the Xserver uses to communicate to the application and vice versa. The Xserver also contains some amount of application
  state that is detailed in the X standard and also potentially some set of extended state that comes from extensions to the X server. Details
  on extensions are all over the place and hard to figure out. Basically what we want to happen is have an application disconnect and reconnect to a
  potentially new Xserver. How would someone do this? Well my idea is almost the same as Guievict's. First you specify where the Xserver is listening;
  that's either a tcp/ip port or a unix socket. Then you do some work to find out all of your applications unique IDs with the Xserver. There could be
  one or many IDs that your application is using. You start intercepting traffic and talking to the application as if you were the Xserver (have it hide itself or
  something), then you enumerate the extensions it's using and offload all state that the application has tied up with the Xserver to disk. Then disconnect on the applications
  behalf. So now the application is running talking to your application and thinking it's the Xserver. I think everything up to this point is feasible, but
  very difficult. Now you use CIRU to checkpoint the application+your program. Now on the restore you must specify where the Xserver is listening again.
  Check to make sure it supports all the extensions your application had, then start negotiating connections and restoring state for your application.
  Once everything is restored (which is no trivial feat) you must somehow get your application to change the Id it is using to talk to the Xserver (or leave your
  application running ontop of the original at all times to constantly translate Xserver requests for it. << This seems like a really good idea imo.

  - TODO Read more documentation and revise steps below
    So I think our best bet here is to look into how guievict did things.
    There is a pdf with its documentation located here https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix03/tech/full_papers/full_papers/zandy/zandy.pdf
    Sadly the university that was hosting the source code and binaries took them down and all that's left is the original paper by Zandy and et al.
    I honestly don't think it will be too bad, but only time will tell.

  - [2020-07-01 Wed 12:23] *Initial analyzation of the problem*
    The main issue we're trying to solve here is the collection of the xserver's
    state and it's restoration.
    I think I should break this problem down into a few parts.
    The first step is the collection of all the application's xserver state.
    Then we need to integrate the collection of that state into ciru's checkpointing process.
    Second we need to find a way to restore the application's xserver state.
    Then integrate the restoration of that state into ciru's restore process.
    I'm going to add these tasks to the global problem description.
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 12:35] *Discovery of xmove*
    I found an application called xmove that kinda does what I want to do.
    Here's a link to the documentation I'm currently reading I'll detail what I understand here as well
    [[https://wenku.baidu.com/view/03699041336c1eb91a375d18.html?from=related]]
    So xmove isn't exactly what I want, but I think it can put me on the right track. How xmove works is as a
    psudo xserver. It sits between connections and the actual xserver and records their state as they send it to the
    xserver. I don't want a second xserver. I just want something that querys the xserver for my applications state
    and then restore's it later. I'm hoping in understanding how xmove works I can understand what state I would need
    to query for to restore my application.
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 14:50] *Sad news can't use xmove or xpra*.
    I was hoping I could use xmove or xpra to accomplish my goals, but they don't really help me at all.
    They kinda do what I need them to do, but in a way that I don't want. I want a more lightweight solution.
    I don't want to have install and run an entire and seperate xserver to pull off this trick. So I'm going to have
    to start reading some of the X11 documentation to understand what messages I'm going to have to send and such.
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 15:04] *Decided to use xcb*
    I'm still not sure on what all the state I need to capture is,
    but I've decided to use xcb to communicate with xserver. I think
    it's the most reasonable choice overall. I've also begun to setup a project
    located here [[~/Code/CriuXserver]]
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 16:05] *An issue I think I'll have to deal with*
    So xserver gives each client a unique client id that it uses to communicate to xserver with.
    The issue I think I'm going to run into is that when ciru checkpoints an application the application
    is still in a state in which it is connected to the xserver and has a particular client id, but when I
    resume it the xserver may have reserved that id for someone else and it may have to get a new id. So I need
    to find an application agnostic way to have it relinquish it's old client id and accept a new one bestowed upon it
    by the xserver.
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 16:24] *On the issue and plan of attack*
    I can't really start yet. I still need to work on figuring out how exactly
    I'm going to tackle the problem. The issue I mentioned before is really throwing
    a wrench in my plans. I'm still most likely going to use xcb, but I need to read more
    documentation. I'm currently reading the following.
    [[https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html]]
  - [2020-07-02 Thu 07:39] *Guievict*
    I found a piece of software called guievict that does exactly what I want to do.
    Well I found mention of the software It seems to have disappeared from the internet only a few
    mentions here and there. It used to have a wikipedia page, but it no longer does. I'm hoping it's
    still around somewhere.
    I think I'm going to have to reimplement it.
    Here's the paper that describes it's implementation.

       I think I should enable debugging and go from there.
     - [2020-07-28 Tue 21:13]
       So we crash shortly after *rtw_chk_start_clnt_join* finishes executing.
       We get this Debug message to help us out "RTW: rtw_chk_start_clnt_join(wlp38s0f3u4) union: 11,0,0".
     - [2020-08-04 Tue 08:58]
       I have a "level 5" debug log from a few of the same types of crashes in /Code/Temp/tmp.
     - [2020-08-04 Tue 09:44]
       So I think this is the most interesting tidbit to first look through.
       It happens a bit before every crash. I really want to know what "Reason 1" is.
       I think this is where I'm going to begin investigating.

         So there are some uninitialized structs in linux/ioctl_cfg80211.c that cause the crash. I fixed that, but there's
         still the random disconnects.

    I'm going to try to get back into the swing of using this journal.
    I want to read what I've written every morning in here.
    
    I want to start daily orging again. Using this file everyday during the
    summer made me feel good. Even on days where I didn't accomplish much
    I still felt good when I wrote and updated my org file. Also it gives my
    life direction. I also want to start consitently getting up early again.
    I think I'm going to set my sights on getting up at 6:30 every morning and
    just killing my day. Also less social media is a goal for me. I'm going to stop 
    using global reddit. I want to allow a couple subreddits, but that is it.

    I felt like Heather was overly nice to me and excited to see me at Lauren and Jake's
    Halloween get together. I think she's in an interesting spot in her life and I don't
    want to take advantage of that. Things seemed to be interesting between her and her
    current boyfriend.

      It's been a week since I've written in here. I've not been very consistent with updating my org file.
      I need to get up and do this every morning. I think my routine should be 6:00 wakeup even if tired >shower > coffee > org > doordash > piano > math > programming > philosophy.

      I don't have much to write today. Got the majority of the stuff moved over from my apartment. I had slept pretty poorly the other night.
      I setup my desk and am hoping my parents are going to let me keep it the way that I have it. I like having a little bit of office space where I can think.
      I really wish I would stop plucking beard hairs out of my chin. Also my fingers hurt I think it's from the oxyclean. It did a good job on cleaning the pit
      stains out of my shirts. I should probably add another reminder about that. Welp I'm going to go brush my teeth and read. Night.

      Just woke up fully about an hour ago. I slept like 12 hours last night. Not sure what caused that I'm thinking either the exercise
      That I've been getting, or the late night cookies I had. I'm really stressed about what I should do about school. We need to sit down
      either today or tomorrow and figure that out.

      Good morning Austin. I'm pretty tired today. Made an ok cup of coffee. I need to go out and do some shopping either today or tomorrow.
      I should go to like a kohls or something to get more undershirts. I kinda want to see where /r/malefashion gets their undershirts. I also need
      to see what I can use to get pit stains out of shirts. I think I'm going to try oxyclean. Still working on moving out of the apartment right now.
      I'm kinda starting to see how the journal looks over the course of a month. I'm actually suprised it's been that long. It's also neat to see how
      information kinda sticks after a while. Welp I think I'm going to get off of here finish my coffee, then go back to my apartment again.

      Currently sitting on the toilet naked in my apartment in oxford. Just went for a walk around the school. I got really sweaty so I'm having my clothes dry.
      After the pits on my shirt dries I'm going to load up my car with a few boxes of my stuff and head out. What else should I put in here? I'm unsure, but
      I feel like I should write more.

     I like taking baths on the hottest water setting because of how relaxing it is getting out,
     but I'm always afraid of the bath while taking it and I can't figure out why. I know the water isn't hot enough to harm me,
     since the hot water heater is set within safe limits. This time while bathing I was trying to focus on my breath and meditate,
     so I could ignore the feeling of fear. Everytime the thoughts telling me that I should get out of the water along with a feeling of discomfort entered
     my mind I would recognize them as they were and return to my breath without following through on them. While repeating this pattern over and over again
     I began to notice how these thoughts were accompanied by my pounding heart. I then made the connection that my heart rate normally increases like this when I'm afraid, 
     but this increase in heart rate wasn't from the fear. It was from the hot water and my body's natural response to keep itself cool.
     I think my mind had been associating the increase in heart rate with me being afraid and would then fill my mind with discomfort and fearful thoughts.
     In the end there was no object actually creating the fear; just my mind interpreting a physiological response that is normally associated with fear as a need
     to be afraid. I'm reminded of the Bene Gesserit's litany of fear from Frank Herbert's Dune.

      I must not fear.
      Fear is the mind-killer.
      Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
      I will face my fear.
      I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
      And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
      Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
      Only I will remain.

      Woke up early this morning. I'm hoping being home is going to make it easy to get a solid sleep routine down.
      I'm hoping to hear back about a job this week. Fingers crossed. I think I'll leave for my apartment around 9.
      My goal is to get the clothes situation figured out and potentially the kitchen. I would love to bring my desk over too,
      but I want to figure out if I can set it up first.

      I decided to drink with Isaiah and Taylor last night. I got very drunk. I spilt my foot water. Felt bad and slept at their place.
      I was very drunk. I wasn't too hungover when I got up this morning. Got mcdonalds then masturbated. Afterwards I began working on packing up
      the apartment. I'm pretty hungry right now, but I kinda want to fast again. I'm taking a break at the moment from packing up all of my stuff.

      I'm trying to remember where I left off on chronocling the foot thing.
      I guess I'll just wait till I get back to my place to write down some more of the details and put up pictures.
      I wrote most of it in the one journal (Maybe I should create links in my journals? I don't think that's something
      I want to have to maintain. My habit of working on this file has kinda died off. I want to start a habit of getting up
      at 5 and going to bed at 9:45. Then spend at least 30 minutes to an hour working on this file every morning. I think it would
      be awesome. Right now I'm sitting in the recliner in Mimi and Pa's bonus room while Pa plays his guitar. I love the way my
      laptop sits in my lap. It is very satisfying. It makes me feel really good. The slight slant and the comfyness of the screen.
      I think I want to update the font on my laptop to reflect the same font as my desktop. I also like the way my macbook's keyboard
      feels. If I get a new job do I want to buy a new laptop? I don't think I do. I think I have a few more good years in my macbook.
      Maybe get a replacement battery, but that's about it. I like where everything else is on this machine. I'm just writing down
      the first things that come to mind right now. It's quite satisfying. I think this is one of the secrets to writing I was missing.
      The ability to freely write down every thought that appears, then reflect on it. Like if I were writing some form of story I think
      I'd write for as long as ideas flow, then go back and refactor and expand specific sections of the story's structure. Well. I think
      I'm going to stop writing in the journal and move on to other parts of the file. But before I do that I want to talk more about how satisfying
      the automatic feeling of typing on the keyboard is.

      So I'm currently at Mimi and Pa's. I've been here since friday.
      I decided to visit Isaiah and Taylor last Monday right after moving
      this file over to my desktop (I'm back on my laptop now.) While I was there
      I dropped their "Prosperity Toad" on my toe. I knocked it off with the box containing
      old video games on the coffee table. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but it damaged my
      toe pretty bad. I then stayed with them that night. We drank and smoked weed. I iced my foot and Taylor
      gave me Advil to take for the pain. While I was there we also watched two movies. Pulp Fiction and Jack and Jill.
      Pulp Fiction was better than I remember it. It was hilarious. We decided to smoke herb afterwards. While smoking I kinda
      talked Taylor into it. I was asking what she was afraid of and was trying to rationalize her fear, but because we were unable
      to rationalize it we decided that it didn't make sense to be afraid. After smoking we started watching the movie Jack and Jill;
      it was actually a lot better than I thought it would be.
    - [2020-07-13 Mon 17:25]
      I think I want to finish my tale of the past few days. After watching Jack and Jill we fell asleep and I stayed at their place the next day as well.
      I spent that whole day just suffering from the pain in my foot. It was not a fun time. I also cooked curry for them. I hope they enjoyed it.
      I thought it was pretty good. I then went home and.

     I find it funny that my only entry in yesterday's journal
     was "Just woke up" Today was fun. I woke up and watched Jake play dwarffortress.
     Oh yeah yesterday I went to Jake and Lauren's place and watched fireworks. Jake got
     paranoid, but that was entertaining.

      Sat outside for a bit. It was warm, but the heat felt good on my

      I'm so sleepy it's unreal. I think I got at least 6 hours worth, so that's not too bad.

      Good morning. I've been awake for a bit now, but I'm just now getting on the computer.
      My goal is to make this a habit. When I first woke up around 6ish I was struggling.
      I felt a strong, but dullish pain in my legs. It kind of reminded me of being sore.
      I think it's from all of the walking I've been doing here lately, but it was way worse
      than my usual soreness. I tried to go back to sleep for a couple hours, but just kinda ended
      up lying there in pain. I had a lot of strange dreams last night; I'm going to attribute that to
      the melatonin I took. I couldn't tell what was real vs what was a dream most of the night.
      I'm kinda sleepy this morning, but I attribute that to the poor sleep I got last night. I don't mind
      it though I need to get my sleep schedule back to some semblance of normalcy.

      I think I'm finially going to cleanup my kitchen. I've been putting it off for a bit too long.
      There are so many moldy dishes in there that it's a real struggle.

      Cleaned up all of those old kombucha glasses to reuse for holding liquids.
      Still have some cleaning to do in the kitchen. I kinda want to get that done today,
      so it won't stink as bad. Started listening to the "Rational Security" podcast that
      Israel recommended. It's pretty good so far. I do like it.

      Just got back from a walk. Man I'm sweaty after that one. Did the whole loop (except for where they closed the road).
      I guess I might just log that too since that's kinda what I want to use this for. The road was closed on the one road (chestnut I think)
      right where the kroger is. It's the same one that the cvs and liqour store is on.
      My apartment smells. It's probably because of that moldy soup in that pot. I need to bring myself to cleaning it out. I just haven't yet.
      I'm actually really tired from the poor sleep I got last night.

      Been doing some programming. I'm having fun with this project I spontaneously picked up this morning. I'm still trying to get the adhesive
      off these kombucha bottles that I have. I love that the glass bottle has a heart on the bottom.

      I cleaned more of the dishes I think the smell
      should begin to disapate. I checked the laundry room
      and that guys laundry is still there.
      I'm drinking an ice cold beer I threw in the freezer.
      It's got a tiny bit of slush making it perfect. I also
      messed around a lot and watched some starcraft.

      I'm getting ready to head to bed.
      I want to get my bed time sort of normalized to be around 9.
      I took an additonal walk was good. I also got another match on tinder.
      I'm pretty tired now. I also want to start moving my commits on this journal to
      a once a day kind of thing. I think that would be pretty reasonable. Welp good night.

      I've decided to start tracking my life in org mode.
      One of the things I want to accomplish with this is daily journaling.

      Another thing I want to work on with this shift is better habits.
      I want to build routines that become automatic and help me work
      towards becoming the self that I want to be.
      Another note on that self bit. I'd like to maybe through this
      try and begin to understand what a self is.

      Just got back from a walk. I thought a lot about myself.
      One of the thoughts I had was on how self is an illusion.
      One of the viewpoints I take on it is that of an inconsistent
      story being collectively told over time by many people.
      I also saw a deer. I took some pictures. I'd look to put the pictures
      in here, but I can't quite yet. I need to add file transfer support from
      android to my gentoo system.

      I decided to go ahead and email the photos to myself lest I forget.
