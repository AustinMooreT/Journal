    Good morning. I've been awake for a bit now, but I'm just now getting on the computer.
    My goal is to make this a habit. When I first woke up around 6ish I was struggling.
    I felt a strong, but dullish pain in my legs. It kind of reminded me of being sore.
    I think it's from all of the walking I've been doing here lately, but it was way worse
    than my usual soreness. I tried to go back to sleep for a couple hours, but just kinda ended
    up lying there in pain. I had a lot of strange dreams last night; I'm going to attribute that to
    the melatonin I took. I couldn't tell what was real vs what was a dream most of the night.
    I'm kinda sleepy this morning, but I attribute that to the poor sleep I got last night. I don't mind
    it though I need to get my sleep schedule back to some semblance of normalcy.

  :WEATHER:
  - Shortly after waking up it started raining.
    Now it's fairly warm. I think around 80. No just 73.
  - I went for a walk and the weather was great for it.
    It was warm, but not too warm and the humidity from the
    rain made it kinda sticky, but I enjoyed it.

    I've decided to start tracking my life in org mode.
    One of the things I want to accomplish with this is daily journaling.
    I kind of want

    Another thing I want to work on with this shift is better habits.
    I want to build routines that become automatic and help me work
    towards becoming the self that I want to be.

    Another note on that self bit. I'd like to maybe through this
    try and begin to understand what a self is.

    Just got back from a walk. I thought a lot about myself.
    One of the thoughts I had was on how self is an illusion.
    One of the viewpoints I take on it is that of an inconsistent
    story being collectively told over time by many people.
    I also saw a deer. I took some pictures. I'd look to put the pictures
    in here, but I can't quite yet. I need to add file transfer support from
    android to my gentoo system.

    I decided to go ahead and email the photos to myself lest I forget.
