      Today is even worse than yesterday. I hope I can get my sleep under control tonight.
      I'm so sleepy it's unreal. I think I got at least 6 hours worth, so that's not too bad.
      I've actually been awake since 4 this morning. Just now am getting up and about. Went to
      McDonalds for breakfast.
    - [2020-07-02 Thu 12:37]
      I fell asleep and slept way too long. I'm probably not going to be able to get to bed at a
      decent time tonight. This sucks. I wish I wasn't so stupid and messed up my sleep like this.
    - [2020-07-02 Thu 14:39]
      Feel kinda lost at what I should do. Fixed part of the wine install. Should note that here.
      I think I'm going to program on the vulkan project.
    - [2020-07-02 Thu 15:30]
      Spent some more time organizing things I like this a lot. I really want to focus on making entering things into this
      file a habit. Organizing my life into these sections could be really helpful. I want to build up habits around everything in here.
    - [2020-07-02 Thu 19:38]
      Feeling really good about my current org mode setup. I like the way my project structure is coming together.
      I'm still kinda procrastinating the whole job thing though.

      Good morning. I've been awake for a bit now, but I'm just now getting on the computer.
      My goal is to make this a habit. When I first woke up around 6ish I was struggling.
      I felt a strong, but dullish pain in my legs. It kind of reminded me of being sore.
      I think it's from all of the walking I've been doing here lately, but it was way worse
      than my usual soreness. I tried to go back to sleep for a couple hours, but just kinda ended
      up lying there in pain. I had a lot of strange dreams last night; I'm going to attribute that to
      the melatonin I took. I couldn't tell what was real vs what was a dream most of the night.
      I'm kinda sleepy this morning, but I attribute that to the poor sleep I got last night. I don't mind
      it though I need to get my sleep schedule back to some semblance of normalcy.

      I think I'm finially going to cleanup my kitchen. I've been putting it off for a bit too long.
      There are so many moldy dishes in there that it's a real struggle.
    - [2020-07-01 Wed 10:49]
      Cleaned up all of those old kombucha glasses to reuse for holding liquids.
      Still have some cleaning to do in the kitchen. I kinda want to get that done today,
      so it won't stink as bad. Started listening to the "Rational Security" podcast that
      Israel recommended. It's pretty good so far. I do like it.
    - [2020-07-01 Wed 14:40]
      Just got back from a walk. Man I'm sweaty after that one. Did the whole loop (except for where they closed the road).
      I guess I might just log that too since that's kinda what I want to use this for. The road was closed on the one road (chestnut I think)
      right where the kroger is. It's the same one that the cvs and liqour store is on.
      My apartment smells. It's probably because of that moldy soup in that pot. I need to bring myself to cleaning it out. I just haven't yet.
      I'm actually really tired from the poor sleep I got last night.
    - [2020-07-01 Wed 16:22]
      Been doing some programming. I'm having fun with this project I spontaneously picked up this morning. I'm still trying to get the adhesive
      off these kombucha bottles that I have. I love that the glass bottle has a heart on the bottom.
    - [2020-07-01 Wed 18:39]
      I cleaned more of the dishes I think the smell
      should begin to disapate. I checked the laundry room
      and that guys laundry is still there.
      I'm drinking an ice cold beer I threw in the freezer.
      It's got a tiny bit of slush making it perfect. I also
      messed around a lot and watched some starcraft.
    - [2020-07-01 Wed 22:00]
      I'm getting ready to head to bed.
      I want to get my bed time sort of normalized to be around 9.
      I took an additonal walk was good. I also got another match on tinder.
      I'm pretty tired now. I also want to start moving my commits on this journal to
      a once a day kind of thing. I think that would be pretty reasonable. Welp good night.

      I've decided to start tracking my life in org mode.
      One of the things I want to accomplish with this is daily journaling.
      I kind of want
    - [2020-06-30 Tue 17:15]
      Another thing I want to work on with this shift is better habits.
      I want to build routines that become automatic and help me work
      towards becoming the self that I want to be.
      Another note on that self bit. I'd like to maybe through this
      try and begin to understand what a self is.
    - [2020-06-30 Tue 19:23]
      Just got back from a walk. I thought a lot about myself.
      One of the thoughts I had was on how self is an illusion.
      One of the viewpoints I take on it is that of an inconsistent
      story being collectively told over time by many people.
      I also saw a deer. I took some pictures. I'd look to put the pictures
      in here, but I can't quite yet. I need to add file transfer support from
      android to my gentoo system.
    - [2020-06-30 Tue 19:44]
      I decided to go ahead and email the photos to myself lest I forget.

** TODO Game Engine <<PG1>>
** TODO Add X support CIRU <<PG2>>
  CIRU is a "Checkpoint and Restore" applciation for linux.
  What that means is that it takes all of the process state
  and writes it to disk, and then can restore it at a later date.

  I want to use CIRU to save current window layouts in xmonad to disk.
  The problem with this is that the Xserver stores application state relating
  to X that is not saved by CIRU. The solution would be to query the Xserver and
  obtain all of the info relating to our application, then write that to disk upon
  "checkpoint" and then upon "restore" we reset the X connection and provide it
  with all of the state needed.

  - TODO Read more documentation and revise steps below
    So I think our best bet here is to look into how guievict did things.
    There is a pdf with its documentation located here https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix03/tech/full_papers/full_papers/zandy/zandy.pdf
    Sadly the university that was hosting the source code and binaries took them down and all that's left is the original paper by Zandy and et al.
    I honestly don't think it will be too bad, but only time will tell.
  - TODO Collect application's xorg state NOTE I think the steps below need to be revised after finishing the prior todo [3/7]
    - [X] Finish the Desktop maintenance entry pertaining to emacs and C
    - [X] Setup project with xcb includes
    - [X] Connect to xserver
    - [ ] Figure out what screens my application has windows on
    - [ ] Query xserver for all xclients
    - [ ] Find all clients belonging to my application
    - [ ] Enumerate all their attributes and properties
    - [ ] Save attributes and properties to disk

  - TODO Restore application's xorg state

  - [2020-07-01 Wed 12:23] *Initial analyzation of the problem*
    The main issue we're trying to solve here is the collection of the xserver's
    state and it's restoration.
    I think I should break this problem down into a few parts.
    The first step is the collection of all the application's xserver state.
    Then we need to integrate the collection of that state into ciru's checkpointing process.
    Second we need to find a way to restore the application's xserver state.
    Then integrate the restoration of that state into ciru's restore process.
    I'm going to add these tasks to the global problem description.
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 12:35] *Discovery of xmove*
    I found an application called xmove that kinda does what I want to do.
    Here's a link to the documentation I'm currently reading I'll detail what I understand here as well
    [[https://wenku.baidu.com/view/03699041336c1eb91a375d18.html?from=related]]
    So xmove isn't exactly what I want, but I think it can put me on the right track. How xmove works is as a
    psudo xserver. It sits between connections and the actual xserver and records their state as they send it to the
    xserver. I don't want a second xserver. I just want something that querys the xserver for my applications state
    and then restore's it later. I'm hoping in understanding how xmove works I can understand what state I would need
    to query for to restore my application.
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 14:50] *Sad news can't use xmove or xpra*.
    I was hoping I could use xmove or xpra to accomplish my goals, but they don't really help me at all.
    They kinda do what I need them to do, but in a way that I don't want. I want a more lightweight solution.
    I don't want to have install and run an entire and seperate xserver to pull off this trick. So I'm going to have
    to start reading some of the X11 documentation to understand what messages I'm going to have to send and such.
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 15:04] *Decided to use xcb*
    I'm still not sure on what all the state I need to capture is,
    but I've decided to use xcb to communicate with xserver. I think
    it's the most reasonable choice overall. I've also begun to setup a project
    located here [[~/Code/CriuXserver]]
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 16:05] *An issue I think I'll have to deal with*
    So xserver gives each client a unique client id that it uses to communicate to xserver with.
    The issue I think I'm going to run into is that when ciru checkpoints an application the application
    is still in a state in which it is connected to the xserver and has a particular client id, but when I
    resume it the xserver may have reserved that id for someone else and it may have to get a new id. So I need
    to find an application agnostic way to have it relinquish it's old client id and accept a new one bestowed upon it
    by the xserver.
  - [2020-07-01 Wed 16:24] *On the issue and plan of attack*
    I can't really start yet. I still need to work on figuring out how exactly
    I'm going to tackle the problem. The issue I mentioned before is really throwing
    a wrench in my plans. I'm still most likely going to use xcb, but I need to read more
    documentation. I'm currently reading the following.
    [[https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html]]
  - [2020-07-02 Thu 07:39] *Guievict*
    I found a piece of software called guievict that does exactly what I want to do.
    Well I found mention of the software It seems to have disappeared from the internet only a few
    mentions here and there. It used to have a wikipedia page, but it no longer does. I'm hoping it's
    still around somewhere.
    I think I'm going to have to reimplement it.
    Here's the paper that describes it's implementation.
